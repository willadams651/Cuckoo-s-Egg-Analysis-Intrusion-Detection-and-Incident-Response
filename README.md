# Cuckoo’s Egg Analysis – Intrusion Detection and Incident Response

**Author:** William Adams  
**Date:** February 7, 2024

## 📘 Overview

This project is a written analysis of **Cliff Stoll’s investigative techniques** in *The Cuckoo's Egg*, focusing on his strategies for **intrusion detection** and **incident response**. It dissects Stoll's real-life cyber investigation at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the broader implications for modern cybersecurity practices.

## 📄 Project Structure

- `cuckoos_egg_analysis.pdf` or `.docx` (if applicable): Full written report.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions.
- `references.txt`: Bibliographic references and citations (optional).

## 🕵️‍♂️ Key Topics Covered

- **Log Analysis:** How Stoll monitored and printed logs to track unauthorized access.
- **Dictionary Attacks:** How weak passwords were exploited.
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Including buffer overflow (Gnu-Emacs hole) and backdoor creation.
- **Traffic Analysis:** Use of `tcpdump`, packet sniffers, and traceroute to follow network traffic.
- **IP Spoofing and X.25 Protocols:** Obfuscation techniques and how Stoll countered them.
- **Creative Tactics:** Jangling keys to interrupt file transfers and building honeypots.

## 💡 Purpose

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Examine historic intrusion detection methods.
- Understand how foundational cybersecurity principles were applied in a real investigation.
- Explore the evolution of incident response from manual detection to automated systems.
- Highlight the importance of **proactive monitoring**, **user behavior analysis**, and **vulnerability management**.

## 🛠 Tools and Techniques Mentioned
